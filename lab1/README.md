# Lab1

## Introduction

In this lab, you must write unit tests for functions implemented in `main.js`. You can learn how to use classes and functions in it by uncommenting the code in `main.js.` However, you must not alter any lines in it when you handle your code.

## Requirement

1. Write test cases in `main_test.js` and make it to pass the test.
2. Achieve 100% code coverage.
3. Add a badge and make it show `passing` in `README.md` in the root folder.

You can run `validate.sh` in your local to test if you satisfy the requirements.

## Submission

You need to open a pull request to your branch (e.g. 311XXXXXX, your student number) and contain the code that satisfies the abovementioned requirements.

Moreover, please submit the URL of your PR to E3. Your submission will only be accepted when you present at both places.
